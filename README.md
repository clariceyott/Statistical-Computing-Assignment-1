# Statistical Computing Assignment 1

## Problem 1 

Write a function that computes the Laplace approximation of the marginal likelihood associated with a univariate logistic regression.

## Problem 2

Write a function that estimates the coefficients of the univariate logistic regression using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.

## Problem 3

Write a parallel program using the R package snow that computes *in parallel* the Laplace approximation and the estimates of coefficients associated with each univariate
logistic regression of the response binary variable Y on each explanatory variable.
